# cs-go-match-winner

This project provides tools for scraping data and predicting win probabilities of teams in competitive CS:GO matches.
Data is taken from [hltv](https://www.hltv.org). Project presents two approaches for predicting probabilities: 
first is bayesian inference of team strength latent parameters with subsequent transformation to probabilities and second is
calculation of team's statistics by every map for use in classical ml algorithms.
